abstract="Constraint Programming typically uses the technique of depth-first branch and bound as the method of solving optimization problems. Although this method can give the optimal solution, for large problems, the time needed to find the optimal can be prohibitive. This paper introduces a method for using local search techniques within a Constraint Programming framework, and applies this technique to vehicle routing problems. We introduce a Constraint Programming model for vehicle routing, and a system for integrating Constraint Programming and local search techniques. We then describe how the method can be accelerated by handling core constraints using fast local checks, while other more complex constraints are left to the constraint propagation system. We have coupled our local search method with a meta-heuristic to avoid the search being trapped in local minima. Several meta-heuristics are investigated ranging from a simple Tabu Search method to Guided Local Search. An empirical study over benchmark problems shows the relative merits of these techniques. Investigations indicate that the specific long-term memory technique used by Guided Local Search can be used as a diversification method for Tabu Search, resulting in significant benefit. Several new best solutions on the Solomon problems are found in relatively few iterations of our algorithm.",

abstract = { The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is a generalization of the vehicle routing problem where the service of a customer can begin within the time window defined by the earliest and the latest times when the customer will permit the start of service. In this paper, we present the development of a new optimization algorithm for its solution. The LP relaxation of the set partitioning formulation of the VRPTW is solved by column generation. Feasible columns are added as needed by solving a shortest path problem with time windows and capacity constraints using dynamic programming. The LP solution obtained generally provides an excellent lower bound that is used in a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the integer set partitioning formulation. Our results indicate that this algorithm proved to be successful on a variety of practical sized benchmark VRPTW test problems. The algorithm was capable of optimally solving 100-customer problems. This problem size is six times larger than any reported to date by other published research. }

More accurately, since there are only (n âˆ’ 1)â€² possibilities to consider, the problem is to find an efficient method for choosing a minimizing permutation.

There are as yet no acceptable computational methods, and surprisingly few mathematical results relative to the problem. }

abstract = {A new cluster-analysis method, the bond energy algorithm, has been developed recently; it operates upon a raw input object-object or object-attribute data array by permuting its rows and columns in order to find informative variable groups and their interrelations. This paper describes the algorithm and illustrates by several examples its use for both problem decomposition and data reorganization. }

abstract="Recent developments in integer-programming software systems have tremendously improved our ability to solve large-scale instances. We review the major algorithmic components of state-of-the-art solvers and discuss the options available to users for adjusting the behavior of these solvers when default settings do not achieve the desired performance level. Furthermore, we highlight advances towards integrated modeling and solution environments. We conclude with a discussion of model characteristics and substructures that pose challenges for integer-programming software systems and a perspective on features we may expect to see in these systems in the near future.",
